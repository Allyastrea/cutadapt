cutadapt
========

cutadapt removes adapter sequences from high-throughput sequencing
data. This is necessary when the reads are longer than the molecule that
is sequenced, such as in microRNA data.

cutadapt is implemented in Python. It comes with an extension module
written in Cython that implements the alignment algorithm.
